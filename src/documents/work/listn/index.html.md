[Listn](http://getlistn.com) is an iPhone app that lets people *share* and *connect* through *music*. By enabling users to explore other people's music libraries from around the world, Listn acts as the social front end to services like YouTube, Spotify, and Rdio.

Magnetic Bear Studios built the iPhone app in collaboration with the Listn team during their stay at [Founder Fuel](http://founderfuel.com)'s Fall 2012 cohort.

This app is launching on The App Store soon. For more info and to get notified when Listn launches, visit [getlistn.com](http://getlistn.com).
