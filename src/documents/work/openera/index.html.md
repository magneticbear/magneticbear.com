quote: "JP and Magnetic Bear are true professionals and bring a level of enthusiasm and expertise to projects that is rare. They have the experience to tell you what you don't want to do, why... and most importantly, what you can do to meet your objectives. It always turns out better than my original idea. Lastly, JP & MBS are fast. They can turn around quality work faster than any other firm I've worked with. I don't hesitate to recommend JP or MBS."

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
