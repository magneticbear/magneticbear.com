<p>Scala1 is a cross-platform conference app that allows you to search through events and speakers and get more information about the conference. It let's attendees create and edit their profiles and also live chat with one another. Users can also find others with live feedback on the map and create a private chat with them. This app featured a Playground so attendees can add functionality and is built for both iOS and Android. Scala1 was used by over 500 attendees in a Java conference in 2012 in San-Francisco. This project is open sourced and available github.com/magneticbear/Scala1.</p>
