Scala1 is a cross-platform conference app that allows you to search through conference specific events and speakers to gather information about them. The app also lets attendees create and edit personal profiles as well as chat live with other attendees.

Users can locate one another via live feedback on a map and set up private chats.

The app is fully open source and features a Playground so that attendees can add their own functionality. Scala1 is built using hybrid native/HTML5 technologies on both iOS and Android.

Scala1 was used by over 500 attendees at the 2012 Java conference in San-Francisco. This project is open sourced and available on [Scala1-iPhone](https://www.github.com/magneticbear/scalaone_iphone), [Scala1-Android](https://www.github.com/magneticbear/scala1_android), [Scala1-Backend](https://github.com/tindr/TypesafeCon).

This app is now available on [The App Store](http://mgn.tc/s1ios) and [google play](http://mgn.tc/s1android). For more info, visit [Typesafe.com](http://typesafe.com).
