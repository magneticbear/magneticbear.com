<p>iDelete is an easy-to-use messaging app that allows users to send and receive texts and images securely via the iPhone through a 256-bit encryption. Each message has a self-destruct timer and once the message has been read and the timer reaches zero, the message deletes itself.  The blur effect is a unique feature that allows users to blur text or images so that they cannot be read.  These message can only be seen by holding onto a specific area of the message, which will then reveal the content. The app is designed to be very easy to use and has a simplified user experience. In addition, magnetic bear created a marketing website to provide potential users with more information about the app.</p>
<p>This app is now available on the App Store. For more info, please check out <a href="http://idelete.com/" target="_blank">iDelete.com</a></p>
