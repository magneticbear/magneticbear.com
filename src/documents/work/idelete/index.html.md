<p>iDelete is a <b>secure</b> and <b>easy to use</b> messaging app that lets you send and receive text and images securely.</p>
<p>The main scope of this secure messaging iPhone app is to let users send and receive text/image from their iDevice through a 256 bit encryption. Each message has a <b>self-distruct timer</b> which deletes itself after being read by the user or after a specific time. One of the neat features implemented in this app is the text/image <b>blur</b> effect. By turning the blur on text/image will get blurred so the receiver can only reveal an specific portion of the content at a time by holding on the text/image. We also created a marketing website so people can go and learn more about the about.</p>
<p>This app is now available on App Store. For more info please visit <a href="http://idelete.com/" target="_blank">iDelete.com</a></p>
