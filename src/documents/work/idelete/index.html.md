<p>iDelete is an easy-to-use messaging app that allows you to send and receive texts and images securely. This iPhone app enables users to send and receive texts/images securely from their iPhone through a 256-bit encryption. Each message has a self-destruct timer, where it deletes itself after being read by the user. Another great feature that makes this app unique is the blur effect. You can add blur to your text or images so once the receiver gets your message blurred. The blurred message can only be shown by holding onto a specific area of the message, which will then reveal the content. The app is designed to be very easy to use and a simplified user experience. We also created a marketing website so people can go and learn more about the app.</p>
<p>This app is now available on App Store. For more info please visit <a href="http://idelete.com/" target="_blank">iDelete.com</a></p>
